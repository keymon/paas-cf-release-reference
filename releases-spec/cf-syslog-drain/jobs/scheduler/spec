properties:
  scalablesyslog.scheduler.health:
    description: The port for the scheduler health endpoint.
    default: 8080
  scalablesyslog.scheduler.pprof:
    description: The port for pprof on the scheduler.
    default: 0

  scalablesyslog.adapter.addrs:
    description: |
      A collection of adapter addresses. This is used only if the
      adapter_adders link is not provided.
    default: []
  scalablesyslog.adapter.port:
    description: The port used to communicate with the adapters via gRPC.
    default: 4443

  scalablesyslog.scheduler.tls.client.ca:
    description: |
      When the scheduler communicates with the adapters it must validate the
      adapters' certificates were signed by a trusted CA. This is the CA
      trusted by the scheduler for that communication.
      Note: This is also used when communicating with the metron agent when
      sending metric data.
  scalablesyslog.scheduler.tls.client.cert:
    description: |
      This certificate is sent to the adapters when initiating a connection.
      It must be signed by a CA that is trusted by the adapters.
      Note: This is also used when communicating with the metron agent when
      sending metric data.
  scalablesyslog.scheduler.tls.client.key:
    description: |
      This is the private key for the certificate sent to the adapters when
      initiating a connection.
      Note: This is also used when communicating with the metron agent when
      sending metric data.
  scalablesyslog.scheduler.tls.client.adapter_cn:
    description: |
      When the scheduler communicates with the adapters it must validate the
      adapters' common name (CN) or subject alternative names (SANs) against
      the hostname or IP address used to initiate the connection. Since we
      use a custom CN for adapters this must be set to that value for
      validation to be successful.

  scalablesyslog.scheduler.tls.api.ca:
    description: |
      When the scheduler communicates with the Cloud Controller it must
      validate the Cloud Controller's certificate was signed by a trusted CA.
      This is the CA trusted by the scheduler for that communication.
  scalablesyslog.scheduler.tls.api.cert:
    description: |
      This certificate is sent to the Cloud Controller when initiating a
      connection. It must be signed by a CA that is trusted by the Cloud
      Controller.
  scalablesyslog.scheduler.tls.api.key:
    description: |
      This is the private key for the certificate sent to the Cloud Controller
      when initiating a connection.
  scalablesyslog.scheduler.tls.api.cn:
    description: |
      When the scheduler communicates with the Cloud Controller it must
      validate the Cloud Controller's common name (CN) or subject alternative
      names (SANs) against the hostname or IP address used to initiate the
      connection. Most of the time this should be the hostname defined in
      scalablesyslog.scheduler.api.url.
  scalablesyslog.scheduler.tls.api.skip_cert_verify:
    description: Allows insecure TLS connections to the Cloud Controller.
    default: false

  scalablesyslog.scheduler.bosh_dns:
    description: Enable Bosh DNS. Disabling this implies Consul DNS.
    default: false
  scalablesyslog.scheduler.api.url:
    description: |
      The URL of the Cloud Controller, used for getting syslog drain bindings.
    default: ""
  scalablesyslog.scheduler.api.polling_interval:
    description: |
      The interval at which the scheduler will poll the Cloud Controller for
      bindings.
    default: 15s
  scalablesyslog.scheduler.api.batch_size:
    description: |
      The batch size the scheduler will request the Cloud Controller for
      bindings.
    default: 1000

  scalablesyslog.scheduler.blacklisted_syslog_ranges:
    description: |
      A list of IP address ranges that are not allowed to be specified in
      syslog drain binding URLs.
    default: []
    example: [{start: 10.10.10.1, end: 10.10.10.10}]

  scalablesyslog.scheduler.metric.addr:
    description: |
      The address used to send metric data to metron.
    default: localhost:3458
  scalablesyslog.scheduler.metric.cn:
    description: |
      When the scheduler communicates with metron it must validate metron's
      common name (CN) or subject alternative names (SANs) against the
      hostname or IP address used to initiate the connection. Since we use a
      custom CN for metron this must be set to that value for validation to be
      successful.
    default: metron

  metric_emitter.interval:
    description: The interval that metrics are emitted to metron.
    default: 1m
